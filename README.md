# democracy_for_sale

Democracy for sale is a website available to the public allowing people to quickly search the congressional representatives of Virginia and Maryland.

We used Leaflet and the Mapbox API to render our map, and pulled information from a .geoJSON file found [HERE](https://code.highcharts.com/mapdata/) .
The map shows the voting districts of Maryland and Virginia and they are color coordinated by political party. Once a district is clicked, the map will shows the representatives as well as their financial donation source; the information comes mostly from the Google Civics Information API. 

A carousel gives the user detailed information on how to contact their congressional representatives.
